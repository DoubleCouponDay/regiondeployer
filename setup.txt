unload each project and reload them into solution

remove regiondeployer's reference to MoonMachine.Infrastructure and replace it with a reference to your local MoonMachine.Infrastructure's release dll.

create an app config
	fill the values into a hiddenstore.cs file in moonmachine.credentials project.

	import the project as a release build stand alone assembly into every project in this repo.

	find your azure sdk credentials by following this guide:
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/azure/dotnet-sdk-azure-authenticate?view=azure-dotnet

create an fsharp file called "personalpaths.fs" in the constants folder.
		fill the missing named parameters accordingly.

		use compilation errors as a guide.

		each personal path must have escaped backslashes like this: C:\\some\\place\\file

testing
	database initial state
		running the test suite in this solution refreshes the database state, specifically the databaseseeding.fs file. 
		
		if it fails, the state will be corrupted.

	run in isolation
		tests should be run one by one
		
		this is to ensure each test has a consistent initial state.

	speed
		these are mostly cloud integration tests. they take a long time to pass.

		sometimes the name of a cloud resource was not random enough and it can return a "conflict result." rerun to get this working.

	setup
		the tests wont pass if groups already exist. 
		
		plan to redeploy after you are done with testing.
